**Library Management System** â€“ A system to track:
- Book inventory and categories
- Author information and relationships to books
- Members and their contact information
- Book loan records including issue and return dates

| Table         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Category**  | Stores categories/genres of books |
| **Book**      | Stores details of books, including title, author field (optional), and foreign key to category |
| **Author**    | Stores author information including name and bio |
| **BookAuthor**| Many-to-many relationship between Book and Author |
| **Member**    | Stores information about library members |
| **Loan**      | Tracks books loaned to members with issue, due, and return dates |

### ðŸ”— Relationships
- `Book` â†’ `Category`: Many-to-One
- `BookAuthor` â†’ `Book` + `Author`: Many-to-Many
- `Loan` â†’ `Book`: Many-to-One
- `Loan` â†’ `Member`: Many-to-One

## ðŸ”¹ Normalization Level

The database is normalized up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:
- âœ… **1NF**: All fields are atomic and unique.
- âœ… **2NF**: Non-key fields depend on the whole primary key.
- âœ… **3NF**: No transitive dependencies.
